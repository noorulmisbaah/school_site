About The Project
#######################
This project is a website for a school called Salsabeel Tahfeez College. It is for demonstration. It has the features that almost all schools have. There is a sign in page, a dashboard for the principal, the head teacher, the staff, the financial officer, and parents.
The website is featured with a results management system where students' results are managed. Results can be processed by entering the CA scores and examinations. The system takes care of all the calculations from the total scores to assigning grades to each each subject. Processed results can be uploaded to the server. Results can be updated, viewed and downloaded, and deleted.
With the powerful results management system, parents can has access to the results of their children. They can view them and download them if they wish.
The website is also built with a section for managing the school financial records.
